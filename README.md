📌 Overview

The Intelligent CPU Scheduler Simulator is a C++ program designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms used in Operating Systems.
It allows users to input process information and obtain computed results such as:

.Completion Time (CT)
.Turnaround Time (TAT)
.Waiting Time (WT)
.Gantt Chart Representation
.Average TAT & WT

This project includes five major scheduling algorithms:

1.FCFS (First Come First Serve)
2.SJF Non-Preemptive (Shortest Job First)
3.SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
4.Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
5.Round Robin (RR)
